Table: Accounts
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:
"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.
Return the result table in any order.
